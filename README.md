# Project Title:
Tic-Tac-Toe game is a project that i developed from scratch to help me find a job as a Front End developer.

# Project Description:
Tic-Tac-Toe is a game for one or two players played on a board of 3x3 or larger grid. 
Each player in turn marks a mark in one of the squares. 
The winning player is the one who managed to fill a row, column or diagonal with his marks. 
If no player has managed to do this until all the squares are full, the game ends in a draw.

This project, developed with React, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
In addition, i used global state and Redux Toolkit, 
because it makes the development more easier, 
and makes the responsability of the components more clearable.
